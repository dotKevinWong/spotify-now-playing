# Spotify Now Playing

A website to display what's currently playing/what I am listening to on my personal Spotify. It displays as an iframe emebed on my [website](https://kevinwong.co). 

A shout out to [@leerob](https://github.com/leerob) for the inspiration and the code that interacts with the Spotify API.

## Getting Started
```bash
$ npm install .
$ npm run dev
```

You will also need a `.env` file with the following [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/) credentials:
```json
client_id=
client_secret=
refresh_token
```

## Tools
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
